# FinanceTracker
This project allows users to track their finances and provides a basic summary of transactions of the various periods. 
This app was primarily built around the assumption that users would be accessing in from a standard desktop browser rather 
than a mobile device. While accessing the website from a mobile device may not look as nice as the desktop version,
all of the features still remain functional. 

## URL
A live version of this site is available at [financetracker.software](financetracker.software).

## TODO
There are currently a number of features that could use improvement or implementation. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>This includes but is not limited to: </b>
<br/>
<br/>
-Filtering and sorting of the transaction log
<br/>
-Allowing users to change passwords (this currently needs to be done manually)
<br/>
-Better optimization for mobile
